#summary Describes how to use Dissy

= Dissy usage =
Open an ELF file from Dissy. It currently needs to be non-stripped.

  * Dissy shows jumps with red links to the destination address
  * A label is used to show call destinations
  * Clicking or pressing enter on calls or jumps will take you to the destination function / address
  * Dissy supports interactive searching for labels and addresses both for functions and instructions. Just start typing.
  * The lookup (use *Ctrl-l* to access) feature allows for looking up pasted addresses or labels. The lookup is intelligent in that it tries to convert common patterns into numbers before reverting to label lookup.
  * Multiple words/addresses in the lookup bar is allowed (and will add a "callchain" to the history)
  * A text entry box for highlighting patterns (use *Ctrl-k* to access) for example to display all accesses to a group of registers
  * History navigation like in web browsers (returning to the last function, *Alt-Left* and *Alt-Right*)
