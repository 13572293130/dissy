**Note!** Dissy has been replaced by a complete re-implementation called EmilPRO, which has many improvements over Dissy. More information about EmilPRO can be found at [emilpro.com](http://www.emilpro.com) and source code is at [github.com/SimonKagstrom/emilpro](https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/emilpro/). I've therefore deprecated Dissy, so you should really take a look at EmilPRO instead!

## Deprecated info ##

Dissy is a graphical frontend to the objdump disassembler. Dissy can be used for debugging and browsing compiler-generated code.
